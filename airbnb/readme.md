# Airbnb CSS

Your assignment is to build the page pictured in the mockup for airbnb

A basic planning structure may be the following steps:

## Wireframe First
Before you write any code, start with a wireframe sketch or "tree diagram" to get a good understanding of the overall structure and hierarchy of the content.

### Example Tree Diagram
The following is an example of what a tree diagram looks like. You can use this as a visualisation tool to help work out your page structure and then translate into proper HTML tags with content.

```
- body
	|- header
		|- logo
		|- nav
	|- main
		|- section
			|- image column
				|- img
			|- description column
				|- heading
				|- description text
				|- button
		|- section
		|- section
	|- footer
		|- copyright message
```

Think in terms of breaking the layout into horizontal rows and vertical columns within each row.

## Structure Second
Next move on to the HTML. Use semantic tags to mark up the page
Add classes to label each element that you will need to style
Think about naming your classes in a systematic way to keep the code organised

## CSS Third
Start by setting up your broad, general styles eg. colors, fonts.

Next move on to the big picture layout.

* Identify where you might need to use flexbox.
* Create flex containers.
* Justify and align the elements inside.

Next move on to reusable elements eg. buttons, location items with background images

Don't worry if your final product isn't perfect =), this is all about improving your personal process and practice, practice, practice!
